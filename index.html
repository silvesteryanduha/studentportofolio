  <h1>WELCOME MY TO MY PORTFOLIO</h1>
  <p>Hello! My name is Silvester Yani Duha. I’m a 7th-semester Informatics Engineering student at STMIK WIDYA UTAMA. I have a strong interest in web development, particularly in creating modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites.
Over the past few semesters, I have worked on various academic and personal projects involving HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and turning ideas into real-world applications.
I’m also familiar with database management using MySQL and MongoDB, and I enjoy exploring both front-end and back-end development. I believe in continuous learning, clean code, and building meaningful digital solutions.
Outside of coding, I enjoy [mention hobby: e.g., graphic design, music, gaming], and I always welcome opportunities to collaborate on tech-related projects.
Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out if you'd like to connect or work together. Thank you for visiting!.</p>
